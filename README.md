Characteristics of plantar loads in maximum forward lunges using pressure measuring insoles.

RESEARCH QUESTION 
To compare the characteristics of plantar loads in maximum forward lunges with pressure 
measuring insoles. 
Aim of the study 
To find and compare the peak pressure of five anatomical parts of the right foot namely forefoot, midfoot, heel, lateral and medial parts while performing maximum forward lunges in stable and 
unstable ground conditions by utilizing Medilogic pressure measuring Insoles.

Participants: 
A total of ten participants both men and women (age 26 ± 6 years, height 165 ± 15cm, body mass 70 ± 10kg) joined in the test with a shoe size ranges from 37 to 45 in Vicon’s lab at the 
university. All the participants reported that they were in generally good physical condition. 

Results:
No Significant Difference in Forefoot Peak Pressure:
Peak pressure on the forefoot did not show a significant difference between stable and unstable ground conditions, contrary to initial hypotheses.

Significant Differences in Midfoot, Heel, Lateral, and Medial Regions:
Peak pressure was lower on unstable surfaces in the midfoot and heel regions, supporting previous findings that softer surfaces reduce impact forces.
Running and lunging on softer surfaces (e.g., grass) alleviates stress compared to harder surfaces like concrete.

Heel Region Experiences Maximum Pressure in Stable Ground:
The heel bears the highest impact force during lunges, often exceeding 70% of body weight.
This is linked to impact shock and overuse injuries common in badminton, fencing, and volleyball players.

Postural Stability on Unstable Surfaces:
On unstable surfaces, heel and forefoot pressures were more evenly distributed, suggesting a compensatory strategy for maintaining balance.

Midfoot Pressure is Generally Lower:
Peak pressure in the midfoot region was lower, especially in high-arched foot individuals, indicating reduced weight distribution in this area.

Lateral and Medial Foot Loading Shift:
Stable conditions: A slight lateral shift in foot loading was observed, possibly due to supporting leg instability.
Unstable conditions: A slight medial shift was noted, reflecting better balance maintenance and control.

Injury Risks in Lunging Movements:
Lunges are a common cause of injuries in sports, with Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, and ankle ligaments being most at risk due to repetitive stop-and-go movements.
Effect Size Analysis (Cohen’s d):

Large effect sizes were observed for peak pressure differences in midfoot, heel, lateral, and medial regions, confirming significant variations between stable and unstable conditions.
